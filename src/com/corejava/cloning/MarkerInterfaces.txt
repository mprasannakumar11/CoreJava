Examples of Marker Interfaces
Serializable:
Classes implementing this interface can be serialized and deserialized.

Cloneable:
Classes implementing this interface can be cloned using the clone() method.

Remote:
Classes implementing this interface can be used in remote method invocation (RMI).

Purpose and Benefits of Marker Interfaces
Type Safety:
Marker interfaces provide a way to indicate that a class supports a specific capability, ensuring type safety during runtime checks.

Metadata Provision:
They act as metadata that can be checked using the instanceof operator or reflection to determine whether a class supports a particular behavior.

Design Flexibility:
Marker interfaces can be used to group related classes and provide a clear and concise way to signal certain capabilities or behaviors.
