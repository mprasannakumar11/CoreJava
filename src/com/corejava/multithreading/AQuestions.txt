If there is 2 synchronised methods m1 and m2 in a class, can 2 different threads t1 and t2 call different methods(m1,m2) respectively on same object of class c at same time ?
Answer â€” No. Only 1 Thread can hold the lock on a object of a class.However the other non synchronised methods can be called on same object.

If a class has a synchronised method and non synchronised method, can multiple threads execute non synchronised methods?
Answer: yes. If a class has a synchronised method and non synchronised method , multiple threads can access non synchronised methods.

Can 2 threads call 2 different static synchronised methods of same class?
Answer : The static synchronised methods of same class always block each other as 1 lock per class exists. So no 2 static synchronised methods can execute at the same time.

Does static synchronised methods block a non synchronised methods?
Answer: No. The thread executing static synchronised method holds a lock on the class and the executing the non static synchronised method holds lock on the object on which the method has been called, these 2 locks are different and these threads dont block eachother.
